# Logging

Primate has three log levels, `error`, `warn` and `info`. As a general rule,
'error' means a severe disruption to the application (and leads to bailout
during startup), 'warn' indicates degraded functionality in an otherwise
nominal system, and 'info' serves to give more information. In terms of
actionability, 'error' logs **must** be addressed, 'warn' logs **should** be
checked, and 'info' logs **may** be ignored.

## Configuring

By default, the error level is to set to `warn`, which logs all errors and
warnings. You can change this in your configuration.

```js primate.config.js
export default {
  log: {
    // show all logs
    level: "info",
  },
};
```

When Primate shows errors or warnings, it will include a short reason and a
quickfix, as well as link to the website for a longer explanation and fix.

```text
?? @primate/store empty store directory
++ populate /home/user/app/stores with stores
   -> https://primatejs.com/modules/store#empty-store-directory
```

## Error

Marked by two red exclamation marks, `!!`.

An error means a severe disruption to the application and must be addressed.
Errors which occur during runtime indicate a severe mismatch between two parts
of an application (for example, trying to use the `view` handler with a file
extension that hasn't been registered by an module).

Errors occuring during startup are bailouts.

### Bailout

Errors occuring during startup result in a bailout and must be addressed before
a restart is possible.

Bailouts are almost always the result of a misconfiguration that would
introduce ambiguity into how Primate operates.

## Warn

Marked by two yellow question marks, `??`.

A warning means degraded functionality in an otherwise functional application,
and should be checked. Warnings usually indicate having configured a certain
feature (like loading a module) but not using it.

## Info

Marked by two green minuses, `--`.

Info logs serve to provide more insight into the internal workings of Primate
and can be usually ignored.

### Possibly intentional

Some info logs are indicated as possibly intentional. This is due to Primate
not knowing if this is due to a client misconfiguration (for example, using
a client that sends alphanumeric strings where numeric strings are expected) or
due to actual client manipulation.

## Fix

Marked by two blue pluses, `++`.

In the cases of known `Warn` and `Error` logs, Primate will suggest a quickfix
which may help addressing the problem, in addition to supplying a link to the
error on the website.

## Error list

### Double Extension

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Two handlers are using the same file extension. File extensions must be
uniquely mappable to a handler. All handlers allow you to use an alternative
file extension.

*Use a different file extension for one of the handlers.*

### Double Module

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Two modules are using the same name in `primate.config.is`. A module's `name`
property is its unique identifier and must not be doubled.

*Load the module only once.*

### Double Path Parameter

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

The same parameter is used twice in one route, as in
`routes/[user_id]/[user_id].js`. Path parameters are mapped to `request.query`
and using the same name twice (with or without a type) creates ambiguity.

*Disambiguate path parameters in route names.*

### Double Route

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

The same route is used twice, as in `routes/user.js` and
`routes/user/index.js` or `routes/post/[foo].js` and `/routes/post/[bar].js`,
creating mapping ambiguity. Routes must be unique, and while you can mix styles
in your application (like `routes/user.js` and `routes/comment/index.js`), you
must not use the same style for the same route.

*Disambiguate the routes by consolidating them into one file of the path style
of your choosing.*

### Empty Config File

Level [`Warn`][warn]

The configuration file at `primate.config.js` was loaded without or with an
empty default export.

*Add configuration options to the file or remove it.*

### Empty Path Parameter

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

A nameless path parameter (`[]`) was found. Primate cannot match empty path
parameters.

*Name the path parameter or remove it.*

### Empty Route File

Level [`Warn`][warn]

A route file without routes was found. An empty file may create the false
impression that it handles certain paths.

*Add routes to the file or remove it completely.*

## Empty Directory

Level [`Warn`][warn]

One of the default directories is empty.

Primate is an opt-in framework, that is most of its aspects, like *routes* or
*types* are only active when their directories exist. Such an empty directory
could mean you intended to use something but haven't.

*Populate the directory with files or remove it completely.*

### Error In Config File

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

JavaScript error encountered when importing `primate.config.js`.

*Check and address errors in the config file by running it directly.*

### Invalid Body Returned

Level [`Error`][error]

Invalid body was returned from route. This is usually caused when you forget to
add a return value from your route.

*Return a proper body from route.*

### Invalid Default Export

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

A file has an invalid default export. Some special files like guards, layouts
or error files must expose a function as their default export.

*Use only functions for the default export of the given file.*

### Invalid Path

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Invalid characters in a path. Path filenames (including directory filenames)
are limited to letters, digits, '_', '[',  ']' or '='.

*Use only letters, digits, '_', '[', ']' or '=' in path filenames.*

### Invalid Type Export

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

A type file has an invalid default export.

*Export object with a `base` string and a `validate` function.*

### Invalid Type Name

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Invalid characters in the filename of a type.

*Use only Latin letters and decimal digits in type filenames, that is
lowercase and uppercase A to Z as well as 0 to 9.*

### Mismatched Body

Level [`Error`][error]

The given content type does not correspond to the actual body contents.

*If unintentional, make sure the body payload corresponds to the used content
type.*

### Mismatched Path

Level [`Info`][info] | [`Possibly Intentional`][possibly-intentional]

Type mismatch in path parameters, precluding the route from executing.

*If unintentional, fix the type or the caller.*

### Mismatched Type

Level [`Info`][info] | [`Possibly Intentional`][possibly-intentional]

Type mismatch during the execution of a route function, stopping the route.
The mismatch happened in a `body`, `query`, `cookies` or `headers` field.

*If unintentional, fix the type or the caller.*

### Modules Has No Name

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Module loaded without a `name` property. Without this property Primate cannot
detect if a module has been loaded more than once.

*If this is a ad-hoc module, add a `name` property to it to make it unique. If
it is a third-party module, contact its maintainer.*

### Modules Must Be Array

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

The `modules` config property must be an array.

*Change the `module` config property to an array or remove it completely.*

### No Handler For Extension

Level [`Error`][error]

No appropriate handler was found for the given file extension using the
[`view`](/guide/responses#view) handler.

*Add a handler module for files of the given extension or change this route.*

### No Route To Path

Level [`Info`][info] | [`Possibly Intentional`][possibly-intentional]

Cannot map the given path to a route, as in `GET /user.js` when `route/user.js`
does not exist or have a `get` property function.

*If unintentional, create an appropriate route function.*

### Reserved Type Name

Level [`Error`][error] | [`Bailout`][bailout]

Reserved type name used. Reserved types are: `get`, `raw`.

*Do not use any reserved name in type filenames.*

[error]: /guide/logging#error
[bailout]: /guide/logging#bailout
[warn]: /guide/logging#warn
[info]: /guide/logging#info
