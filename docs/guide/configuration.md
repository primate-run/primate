# Configuration

Primate is a zero-configuration framework and can be used without a custom
configuration. In most cases the defaults can be left as is.

## primate.config.js

If Primate doesn't find a `primate.config.js` in your project root directory
(the directory where your `package.json` resides) or this file does not export
a default object, Primate will fall back to its default configuration file.

```js
export default {
  base: "/",
  modules: [],
  pages: {
    app: "app.html",
    error: "error.html",
  },
  log: {
    level: "warn",
  },
  http: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 6161,
    csp: {},
    static: {
      root: "/",
    },
  },
  request:
    body: {
      parse: true,
    },
  },
  location: {
    components: "components",
    pages: "pages",
    routes: "routes",
    static: "static",
    types: "types",
    build: "build",
    client: "client",
    server: "server",
  },
  build: {
    name: "app",
    includes: [],
    excludes: [],
    define: {},
  },
};
```

In case you want to override the defaults, create a `primate.config.js` file
in your project root. Primate will read it and merge any overrides with the
default configuration.

To illustrate this, if you wanted to change the default logging level to
`Info` instead of `Warn` and the HTTP port to `6262` you would create a
`primate.config.js` in your project root with the following overrides.

```js
export default {
  log: {
    level: "info",
  },
  http: {
    port: 6262,
  },
};
```

Primate will merge your custom configuration with its default, resulting in
effectively the following configuration.

```js
export default {
  base: "/",
  modules: [],
  pages: {
    app: "app.html",
    error: "error.html",
  },
  log: {
    level: "info",
  },
  http: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 6262,
    csp: {},
    static: {
      root: "/",
    },
  },
  request:
    body: {
      parse: true,
    },
  },
  location: {
    components: "components",
    pages: "pages",
    routes: "routes",
    static: "static",
    types: "types",
    build: "build",
    client: "client",
    server: "server",
  },
  build: {
    name: "app",
    includes: [],
    excludes: [],
  },
};
```

## General options

### base

Default `"/"`

Your app's base path. If your app is running from a domain's root path, leave
the default as is. If your app is running from a subpath, adjust accordingly.

### modules

Default `[]`

Instantiated modules. The order of loading modules affects the order in which
their hooks will be evaluated, and modules can depend on each using
[load hooks][hooks-load].

## Page options

### app

Default: `app.html`

Name of the default HTML page located in `location.pages`. If `location.pages`
does not exist or contain this file, Primate will use its
[default app.html][default-app-html].

### error

Default: `error.html`

Name of the default error HTML page located in `location.pages`. If
`location.pages` does not exist or contain this file, Primate will use its
[default error.html][default-error-html].

## Logging options

For more info on logging, refer to the [Logging](/guide/logging) section.

### log.level

Default `"warn"`

The logging level to be used. Primate has three logging levels, `Error`, `Warn`
and `Info`.

## HTTP options

### http.host

Default `"localhost"`

The HTTP host to be used. This value is directly passed to the runtime.

### http.port

Default `6161`

The HTTP port to be used. This value is directly passed to the runtime.

### http.csp

Default `{}`

The Content Security Policy (CSP) to be used. Empty by default.

If you wanted a fairly restrictive policy, you would use something like this.

```js
{
// all content must come from own origin, excluding subdomains
"default-src": ["'self'"],
// styles must come from own origin, excluding subdomains
"style-src": ["'self'"],
// disallow <object>, <embed> and <applet> elements
"object-src": ["'none'"],
// disallow embedding
"frame-ancestors": ["'none'"],
// all form submissions must be to own origin
"form-action": ["'self'"],
// allow only own origin in <base>
"base-uri": ["'self'"],
}
```

If existing, `script-src` and `style-src` will be concatenated with hashes of
scripts and styles picked up by Primate (either through the `components` or the
`static` directory).

### http.static.root

Default `"/"`

The path at which to serve static assets (those located in the `static`
directory and copied during runtime to the `build/client/static` directory).
Static assets take precedence over routes. This option allows you to have all
static assets served at a subpath, like `/public`.

### http.ssl.{ key, cert }

Default: `undefined`

The path to an SSL key and certificate pair. If both these properties are set
and point to a valid key/certificate pair, Primate will switch to https.
If specified as a relative path, will be relative to project root.

!!!
Primate does not load the key or certificate into memory. It only resolves
their paths as necessary and passes them to [rcompat][rcompat].
!!!

## Request options

### request.body.parse

Default: `true`

Whether the body should be parsed according to the content type. Turning this
off is useful if you're using Primate as a programmable reverse proxy and
forwarding the requests to another app. The headers, the querystring and
cookies will be still parsed and available to `request`, and
`request.original` will contain the untouched original request.

## Location options

Locations of Primate standard directories. If any of these locations are
relative, they will be relative to project root.

### location.components

Default `"components"`

The directory where components are located. [Components](/guide/components) are
used as HTML files or by frontend frameworks. The `view` handler will try to
load any referenced component filename from this directory.

### location.pages

Default `"pages"`

The directory where pages are loaded from. If this directory doesn't exist and
you use the `view` or `html` handler, Primate will use its default `app.html`
as the default page.

### location.routes

Default `"routes"`

The directory where the hierarchy of route files resides.

### location.static

Default `"static"`

The directory from which static assets are copied to the build directory at
`{location.build}/{location.static}`, where `location.build` and
`location.static` are configuration options.

### location.types

Default `"types"`

The directory where types are located. [Types](/guide/types) can be used to
limit the range of possible values that a variable can have in runtime.

### location.build

Default `"build"`

The directory where the app is to be built in and served from. This directory
is recreated during every run.

### location.client

The directory into which client files (compiled components and dependencies)
are copied and from which they are served at runtime.

### location.server

The directory into which server files (compiled components) are copied and from
which they are server-rendered at runtime.

### Build options

### build.name

Default `"app"`

The name of the build, as reflect in the resulting JavaScript and CSS files.

### build.includes

Default `[]`

A list of directories to be included in the server and client build. Must not
be any known Primate location.

### build.excludes

Default `[]`

A list of files to be excluded from bundling. Wildcards can be used.

### build.define

Default `{}`

A map of identifier substitutions during build-time. For example, you could
replace `APP_NAME` with your actual application name, loading from an `.env`
file, by specifying

```js
export default {
  build: {
    define: {
      APP_NAME: "'my-app'",
    },
  },
};
```

Note that subtitutions take place as in -- if you want a string to be
substituted in, you need to quote it properly, as in the example.

## pages/app.html

If you use the `view` or `html` [handler](/guide/responses#view), Primate will
embed the generated HTML from the handler into this file. If an `app.html`
doesn't exist in the `pages` directory, Primate will fall back to its default
app page.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Primate app</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    %head%
  </head>
  <body>%body%</body>
</html>
```

If you create an `app.html` file inside the `pages` directory, Primate will
use it instead. When creating your own file, remember to include the `%head%`
and `%body%` placeholders.

## %head%

This placeholder is replaced by the JavaScript and CSS files Primate finds
inside the `static` directory. You don't need to explicitly include any of
those in the `<head>` and doing so might make your index file drift out of sync
with the [http.static.root](#http-static-root) setting.

## %body%

This placeholder is replaced by whatever HTML code the `view` or `html`
handler generates.
