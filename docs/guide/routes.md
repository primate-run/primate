# Routes

Primate uses filesystem-based routes. Route files are JavaScript files in the
`routes` directory that correspond to their routes. For example, the file
at `routes/user/profile.js` is used to handle a client accessing
`/user/profile`. The path may include parameters in braces, which are
mapped to `request.path`, and which may have types.

To illustrate this, consider that inside `routes`

* `index.js` is mapped to the root route (`/`)
* `user.js` is mapped to `/user`
* `user/{userId}.js` is mapped to a
[route with parameters](#parameters), for example `/user/1` (but also
`/user/donald`)
* `user/{userId=uuid}.js` is mapped to a
[route with typed parameters][types] route where `userId` is of the type `uuid`,
for example `/user/f6a3fac2-7c1d-432d-9e1c-68d0db925adc` (but not `/user/1`)

## HTTP verbs

Every route file exports an object containing one or many HTTP verb functions.

```js caption=routes/user/profile.js
export default {
  get() {
    return "this is a GET request";
  },
  put() {
    return "this is a PUT request";
  },
};
```

In this example, accessing the path `/user/profile` using any of the specified
verbs will return a plain-text response as specified.

## The request object

Route verb functions accept a single parameter representing request data. This
aggregate object allows easy access to the request `body`, any `path`
parameters defined with braces, the `query` string split into parts, `cookies`
as well as other `headers` and a reference to the `original` WHATWG Request 
object. The aggregate nature of this object allows you to pull in what you need
using object destructuring.

### body

The request body.

```js caption=routes/your-name.js
export default {
  post(request) {
    return `Hello, ${request.body.name}`;
  },
}
```

If a client sends a POST request to `/your-name` using the content type
`application/json` and `{"name": "Donald"}` as body, this route will respond
with 200 saying  `Hello, Donald`.

Primate will attempt to decode the body according to the `Content-Type` header
used in the request.

* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which is primarily used in HTML forms,
decodes the form fields into object properties
* `application/json` will decode the given JSON string using `JSON.parse`

```js caption=routes/your-full-name.js
export default {
  post(request) {
    const { name } = request.body;

    if (name === undefined) {
      return "You haven't specified your name";
    }

    return `Hello, ${name}`;
  }
}
```

In this example, if a client sends a request to `/your-full-name` with a
URL-encoded form (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) or JSON data
(`application/json`) with a field `name` in its body, Primate will respond by
saying Hello and the provided name.

### path

The request's path, an object containing named parameters.

```js caption=routes/users/{user}.js
import { error } from "primate";

const users = ["Donald", "Ryan"];

export default {
  post(request) {
    const user = request.path.get("user");

    if (users.includes(user)) {
      return `Hello, ${user}`;
    }

    return error("Unknown user");
  },
};
```

If a user requests POST `/users/Donald` or `/users/Ryan`, Primate will respond
with `200`, saying Hello. It will otherwise reply with `404` saying Unknown
user.

We will later handle [routes with parameters](#parameters) in depth.

### query

The request's query string, broken down into its constituent parts.

```js caption=routes/users.js
import { error } from "primate";

const users = ["Donald", "Ryan"];

export default {
  post(request) {
    const user = request.query.get("user");

    if (users.includes(user)) {
      return `Hello, ${user}`;
    }

    return error("Unknown user");
  },
};
```

If a user requests POST `/users?user=Donald` or `/users?user=Ryan`, Primate
will respond with `200`, otherwise with `404`.

### cookies

The request's `Cookie` header, broken down into individual cookies.

```js caption=routes/current-user.js
import { error } from "primate";

const users = ["Donald", "Ryan"];

export default {
  post(request) {
    const user = request.cookies.get("user");

    if (users.includes(user)) {
      return `Hello, ${user}`;
    }

    return error("Unknown user");
  },
};
```

If a user requests POST `/current-user` with the `Cookie` header set to
`user=Donald` or `user=Ryan`, Primate will respond with `200`, otherwise with
`404`.

### headers

The request's individual headers.

```js caption=routes/current-x-user.js
import { error } from "primate";

const users = ["Donald", "Ryan"];

export default {
  post(request) {
    const user = request.headers.get("X-User");

    if (users.includes(user)) {
      return `Hello, ${user}`;
    }

    return error("Unknown user");
  },
};
```

If a user requests POST `/current-x-user` with a `X-User` header set to
`Donald` or `Ryan`, Primate will respond with `200`, otherwise with `404`.

### original

The `original` property of the request object provides access to the original
WHATWG Request object.

## Parameters

Route paths may contain parameters in braces, which indicate they will be
mapped to `request.path`. Path parameter names are case sensitive, and a
request may contain any number of them, though it must not contain the same
parameter in the same case twice. They must be non-empty, that is matched by
at least one character.

By default, parameters will match anything in the path except `/`, though they
are not greedy. A path like `/users/{userId}a.js` is unambiguous: it will match
any path that starts with `/users/` followed by anything that is not `/`,
provided that it ends with `a`. The last `a` can therefore not be part of
the match.

Such a path will thus be matched by all the following requests.

* `/users/1a`
* `/users/aa`
* `/users/ba?key=value`
* `/users//a` (repeated `/` are only processed ones)

The same path won't be matched by any of the following requests.

* `/user/1a` (does not begin with `/users`)
* `/users/a` (must match at least one character)
* `/users/aA` (paths are case-sensitive, path does not end with `a`)
* `/users/?a` (`?` denotes end of path)

Parameters can be also typed, in which case their value can be restricted.
The types section elaborates on the use of [types in path parameters][types].
