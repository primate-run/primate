Today we're announcing the availability of the Primate 0.32 preview release.
This release introduces support for building native applications with Primate
Native, adds two new frontends, Voby and Eta, and includes a host of other
changes.

!!!
If you're new to Primate, we recommend reading the [Getting started] page to
get an idea of it.
!!!

## Building native applications

Primate native allows you to package your existing project, as-is, into a
desktop application.

!!!
Compilation is currently only supported using Bun. In the future, as runtimes
mature their compilation capabilities, we will add support for Node and Deno.
!!!

### Install

`npm install @primate/native`

### Configure

Import and initialize the module in your configuration.

```js#primate.config.js
import native from "@primate/native";

export default {
  modules: [
    native(),
  ],
};
```

By default, when the application is launched, it will access `/` (the route
at `routes/index.js`. Change that by setting the `start` property during
configuration.

```js#primate.config.js
import native from "@primate/native";

export default {
  modules: [
    native({
      start: "/home",
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Compile

To compile your project, make sure you have Bun installed, and then run

`bun --bun x primate build desktop`

### Cross-compile

Choosing the `desktop` target will detect your current operating system and use
it as the compilation target. To cross-compile, specify the exact target.

`bun --bun x primate build linux-x64`

Currently available targets are `linux-x64`, `windows-x64`, `darwin-x64` and
`darwin-arm64`.

## The future of Primate Native

This release is only the first step towards bringing everything Primate has to
offer to desktop applications. In the next releases, we plan to add support for
additional targets such as mobile devices, as well as provide means to package
apps (`msi`, `dmg`, `deb`, `rpm` and so on). We're also planning on adding
helper functions to detect a user's home as well as config directory. Feedback
and feature requests are welcome.

## New supported frontend: Voby

[Voby] is a high-performance framework with fine-grained signal-based
reactivity for building rich applications.

## Install

`npm install @primate/voby`

## Configure

Import and initialize the module in your configuration.

```js#primate.config.js
import voby from "@primate/voby";

export default {
  modules: [
    voby(),
  ],
};
```

## Use

Create a Voby component in `components`.

```html#components/PostIndex.voby
export default ({ posts, title }) => {
  return <>
    <h1>All posts</h1>
    {posts.map(({ id, title}) => <h2><a href={`/post/view/${id}`}>{title}</a></h2>)}
  </>;
}
```

Serve it from a route.

```js#routes/voby.js
import view from "primate/handler/view";

const posts = [{
  id: 1,
  title: "First post",
}];

export default {
  get() {
    return view("PostIndex.voby", { posts });
  },
};
```

The rendered component will be accessible at http://localhost:6161/voby.

## New supported frontend: Eta

[Eta] is a faster, more lightweight, and more configurable EJS alternative.

### Install

`npm install @primate/eta`

### Configure

Import and initialize the module in your configuration.

```js#primate.config.js
import eta from "@primate/eta";

export default {
  modules: [
    eta(),
  ],
};
```

Create an Eta component in `components`.

```html#components/post-index.eta
<h1>All posts</h1>
<div>
<% it.posts.forEach(function(post){ %>
<h2><a href="/post/view/<%= post.id %>"><%= post.title %></a></h2>
<% }) %>
</div>
```

Serve it from a route.

```js#routes/eta.js
import view from "primate/handler/view";

const posts = [{
  id: 1,
  title: "First post",
}];

export default {
  get() {
    return view("post-index.eta", { posts });
  },
};
```

The rendered component will be accessible at http://localhost:6161/eta.

## Quality of life improvements

## Migrating from 0.31

### HTML removed from core

The [HTML frontend] has been moved from core into its own package,
`@primate/html`. If you previously used HTML components, install
`@primate/html` and load it in your configuration.

### Normalized names for database configuration

All database drivers now use the same terminology to refer to the database to
use. Specifically, the JSON and SQLite drivers previously used the `filename`
property in their configuration to denote the location of the database file.
This is now `database` across the board.

### Changed module imports

All backend, frontend and store modules now reside within their own packages.

```js#primate.config.js
// previously `import { typescript } from "@primate/binding";`
import typescript from "@primate/typescript";

// previously `import { svelte } from "@primate/frontend";`
import svelte from "@primate/svelte";

// previously `import { sqlite } from "@primate/store";`
import sqlite from "@primate/sqlite";
```

### Debarrelled imports for handlers

Primate handlers now use paths instead of named exports.

```js#routes/index.js
// previously `import { view } from "primate";`
import view from "primate/handler/view";

export default {
  get() {
    return view("index.svelte");
  },
};
```

You can apply a [route migration script] your routes directory to convert
all routes to the new format.

!!!
Note that the script won't convert combined imports of the form
`import { view, redirect } from "primate";`.
!!!

### Changed I18N imports

The translation and locale imports of I18N are now imported directly from the
frontend package.

```js#components/index.svelte
<script>
  // previously `import t from "@primate/i18n/svelte";`
  import t from "@primate/svelte/i18n";
  // previously `import { locale } from "@primate/i18n/svelte";`
  import locale from "@primate/svelte/locale";

  let count = 0;
</script>
<h3>{$t("Counter")}</h3>
<div>
<button on:click={() => { count = count - 1; }}>-</button>
<button on:click={() => { count = count + 1; }}>+</button>
{count}
</div>
<h3>{$t("Switch language")}</h3>
<div><a on:click={() => locale.set("en-US")}>{$t("English")}</a></div>
<div><a on:click={() => locale.set("de-DE")}>{$t("German")}</a></div>
```

### Removed modules

Remove any `@primate/types` imports and uses in your configuration file.

### Removed imports

Don't import `Response` anymore, it is available in the global context of all
runtimes.

If you previously imported `Status`, import instead the individual statuses
from `@rcompat/http/status`.


```js
import { OK } from "@rcompat/http/status";

export default {
  get() {
    return new Response("Hello, world!", { status: OK });
  },
};
```

### Removed Logger

Remove any `Logger` imports. You can now set the log level when running
Primate:

`npx primate --loglevel=info`

The log levels stayed the same: `info`, `warn` and `error`.

### Use build.define instead of build.transform

Previously, you could define a `build.transform` and `build.mapper` to specify
textual replacements during build-time. We now use esbuild's identifier
replacement.

```js#primate.config.js
export default {
  build: {
    define: {
      DEBUG: "true",
      APP_NAME: "'Primate'",
    },
  },
};
```

Note that this is an identifier replacement, so if you want the identifier
`DEBUG` to be replaced with boolean `true`, you'd write `DEBUG: "true"`, but if
you want the replacement to be a string, be sure to quote it properly:
`APP_NAME: "'Primate'"`.

[According to esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define), the expression
which the identifier is mapped to can "either be a JSON object (null, boolean,
number, string, array, or object) or a single identifier".

## Other changes

Consult the [full changelog][changelog] for a list of all relevant changes.

## Next on the road

Some of the things we plan to tackle in the upcoming weeks are,

* Multidriver transactions
* Add a `command` hook that would allow modules to register command line
  namespaces, to be able to run `npx primate [namespace] [command] [flags]`
* Use this new hook to create database migrations for SQL-flavored databases
* Add hydration and SPA support for `@primate/vue`
* Flesh out stores with default values, additional predicates and relations
  between tables/collections
* Add more type variants

This list isn't exhaustive or binding. None, some or all of these features may
be included in 0.33, and other features may be prioritized according to
feedback.
